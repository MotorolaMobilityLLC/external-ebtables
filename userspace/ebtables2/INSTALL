FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES:
-------------------------------

If /usr/src/linux contains the patched kernel for ebtables:
	%make install
Otherwise:
	%make KERNEL_DIR=<<where-the-patched-kernel-is>> install

optional:
If your /usr/include/linux directory is a symbolic link, use the SYMLINK=y
option. When unsure, don't use this. If the cp program produces errors
when executing make install, use this option.

WHAT GETS INSTALLED?
--------------------

- The needed kernel headers are placed in /usr/include/linux/netfilter_bridge/
  That's why it needs the KERNEL_DIR. If the SYMLINK=y option is supplied,
  /usr/include/linux will be a symbolic link.
- The ebtables manual gets installed in /usr/local/man/man8
  To put the manual somewhere else, include MANDIR=<<man-path/man>> as
  option on the command line.
  The Makefile will append /man8/ebtables.8.
- ethertypes is placed in /etc/
- the userspace program ebtables is compiled and the executable is copied
  to /sbin/ebtables.

That's all
