FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE GUIDELINES:
-------------------------------

Compiling the source code and putting the files in the right directories:
%make install

If you are using the CVS code or need your own kernel includes, do this
instead (change the include directory to the appropriate one):
%make install KERNEL_INCLUDES=/usr/src/linux/include

WHAT GETS INSTALLED?
--------------------

- The ebtables manual gets installed in /usr/local/man/man8
  To put the manual somewhere else, include MANDIR=<<man-path/man>> as
  option on the command line.
  The Makefile will append /man8/ebtables.8.
- ethertypes is by default placed in /etc/, if you
  want to change this, include ETHERTYPESPATH=<<path>>.
- The pipe used for communication by ebtablesd and ebtablesu is by
  default the file /etc/ebtables-v$(PROGVERSION)/ebtablesd_pipe. To
  change the directory, include PIPE_DIR=<<dir>>. There is no option
  to change the name of the pipe.
- the userspace programs ebtables ebtablesu and ebtablesd are compiled and
  the executables are copied by default to /usr/local/sbin/ebtables. If you want
  to put the executables somewhere else, include BINPATH=<<path>>.

That's all

ADDITIONAL PROGRAM(S):
----------------------
-- examples/ulog/test_ulog.c --

Contains an example to receive and parse netlink messages containing
packets seen by the ebtables ulog watcher.

Compile with:
%make test_ulog.c KERNEL_INCLUDES=/usr/src/linux/include

Usage:
%examples/ulog/test_ulog NETLINK_GROUP
%ebtables -A chain --ulog-nlgroup NETLINK_GROUP

-- examples/perf_test/perf_test --

A test script to compare the performance for the different ways to
construct an ebtables table.
