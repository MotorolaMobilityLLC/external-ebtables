20020414
	* fixed some things in the manual.
	* fixed -P problem.
20020411
	* -j standard no longer works, is this cryptic? good :)
	* lots of beautification.
	  - made some code smaller
	  - made everything fit within 80 columns
	* fix problems with -i and -o option
	* print_memory now prints useful info
	* trying to see the tables when ebtables is not loaded in kernel
	  no longer makes this be seen as a bug.
20020403
	ebtables v2.0 released, changes:
	* A complete rewrite, made everything modular.
	* Fixed a one year old bug in br_db.c. A similar bug was present
	  in ebtables.c. It was visible when the number of rules got
	  bigger (around 90).
	* Removed the option to allow/disallow counters. Frames passing
	  by are always counted now.
	* Didn't really add any new functionality. However, it will be
	  _alot_ easier and prettier to do so now. Feel free to add an
	  extension yourself.
	* There are 4 types of extensions:
	  - Tables.
	  - Matches: like iptables has.
	  - Watchers: these only watch frames that passed all the matches
	    of the rule. They don't change the frame, nor give a verdict.
	    The log extension is a watcher.
	  - Targets.
	* user32/kernel64 architectures like the Sparc64 are unsupported.
	  If you want me to change this, give me access to such a box,
	  and don't pressure me.
