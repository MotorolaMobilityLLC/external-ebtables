			<DL>
				<DT>
What happens when I enable connection tracking?
				</DT>
				<DD>
By default, all IP packets will be seen by the connection
tracking code. This code is called on the PF_INET/PRE_ROUTING
and PF_INET/LOCAL_OUT hooks. For bridged packets, only the
PRE_ROUTING connection tracking is important.
				</DD>
			</DL>

				<DT>
What are the disadvantages of connection tracking on a bridging
firewall?
				</DT>
				<DD>
					<OL>
						<LI>
For an IP packet entering a bridge device, connection tracking
is called before the bridge code decides what to do with the
packet. This means that IP packets that will be discarded by
the bridge code are tracked by connection tracking. For a router,
the same is true, but a bridge also sees the traffic between
hosts on the same side of a network. It's possible to prevent
these packets from being seen by connection tracking: you can
either drop them in the ebtables nat PREROUTING chain or use the
iptables NOTRACK target.
						</LI>
						<LI>
Fragmented IP packets (typically UDP traffic like NFS) are
defragmented by the connection tracking code and refragmented
before sending them out. This slows down traffic, but the
transparancy of the firewall isn't diminished.

			<DL>
				<DT>
What happens with IP DNAT on a to be bridged packet?
				</DT>
				<DD>
If IP DNAT happened then the bridge-nf code asks the routing
table where the packet should be sent. If it has to be sent
over another device (not the bridge device) then the packet is
routed (an implicit redirect). If the routing table sends the
packet to the bridge device, then the packet is bridged but the
MAC destination is correctly changed.
				</DD>
			</DL>
			<DL>
				<DT>
How can I disable bridge-nf?
				</DT>
				<DD>
If you don't want iptables and arptables to see bridged traffic,
you can disable bridge-nf in the 2.6 kernel at compile time by
disabling "Bridged IP/ARP packets filtering".
				</DD>
			</DL>
			<DL>
				<DT>
Can I disable/enable bridge-nf specifics on-the-fly?
				</DT>
				<DD>
As of kernel version 2.6.1, there are three sysctl entries for
bridge-nf behavioral control (they can be found under
/proc/sys/net/bridge/):
					<UL>
						<LI>
bridge-nf-call-arptables - pass (1) or don't pass (0) bridged
ARP traffic to arptables' FORWARD chain.
						</LI>
						<LI>
bridge-nf-call-iptables - pass (1) or don't pass (0) bridged
IPv4 traffic to iptables' chains.
						</LI>
						<LI>
bridge-nf-filter-vlan-tagged - pass (1) or don't pass (0)
bridged vlan-tagged ARP/IP traffic to arptables/iptables.
						</LI>
					</UL>
				</DD>
			</DL>
			
			<DL>
				<DT>
Do {ip,arp}tables see VLAN tagged IP/ARP traffic on an untagged
bridge?
				</DT>
				<DD>
Yes. Kernel versions 2.6.0-test7 and above have this
functionality. Patch ebtables-brnf-3-vs-2.4.22 and later patches
(for 2.4) have this functionality too.
				</DD>
				<DT>
Do {ip,arp}tables see encapsulated 802.2/802.3 IP/ARP traffic?
				</DT>
				<DD>
No. Adding this shouldn't be that hard though.
				</DD>
				<DT>
Does ip6tables see any bridge IPv6 traffic?
				</DT>
				<DD>
Nope, it's on the todo-list.
